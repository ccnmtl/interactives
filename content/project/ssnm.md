title: "Social Support Network Map"
projectdescription: "<p>Social Support mapping grows out of a long social work tradition of starting where a person is and recognizing strengths. It helps a person tap into and use his or her own natural support network to deal with challenging life issues. At a time when mental health interventions are increasingly complicated, it remains a simple and accessible, yet powerful tool to support individuals and families.</p><p>The Social Support Network Map was created in 2005 as a collaboration with Professor Susan Witte at the School of Social Work as an interactive learning tool for classroom instruction.</p>"
