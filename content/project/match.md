title: "Multidisciplinary Approaches to Children's Oral Health (MATCH)"
projectdescription: "<p>Multidisciplinary Approaches to Children's Oral Health (MATCH) is a set of online learning modules which serve as resources for practicing and future pediatric dentists to learn how they can work with other health care professionals to ensure a child's oral health and overall well-being. Children's oral health is determined by social, behavioral, genetic, nutritional, and educational factors--as well as by dental care. MATCH is an innovative effort to demonstrate how partnering with experts from these fields can enhance a dentist's practice and help children and their families obtain the highest levels of oral health.</p><p>MATCH features information on professionals such as social workers and pediatricians and suggests ways dentists can work most effectively with them. Documentary-style videos present interviews with pediatric dentists and other professionals who have successfully worked together.</p><p>The site was developed with Dr. Burton Edelstein, professor of clinical dentistry and clinical health policy and management. MATCH wass funded by a $1.6 million, 5-year grant from the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) for the training of post-doctoral dentists.</p>"
