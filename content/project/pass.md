title: "Population Based Approaches to Patient Service and Professional Success (PASS)"
projectdescription: "<p>Population-Based Approach to Patient Service and Professional Success (PASS) is an online learning project to teach pre-doctoral dental students to consider patient populations when deciding where and how to build a career. PASS offers documentary-style videos of practicing dentists, interactive maps, and information on specific populations. These resources educate students about demographic issues related to career decisions, such as locations of dental practices versus communities underserved by dentists. PASS also aims to show students they can build a successful, satisfying career and include individuals from diverse populations among their patients.</p><p>The site was developed with Dr. Burton Edelstein, professor of clinical dentistry and clinical health policy and management. PASS was funded by a $1.3 million, 5-year grant from the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) for the training of pre-doctoral dentists.</p>"
