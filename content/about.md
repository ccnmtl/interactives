Interactives@CTL is a collection of rich Javascript interactive content developed at Columbia's Center for Teaching and Learning (CTL).

At CTL, client-side interactives enrich many of our serial-learning web applications. These discrete JavaScript blocks challenge students with quizzes, animations, case studies, calculators and games. The goal is to transform a passive reading exercise into an active learning experience. The interactives encourage students to use higher-order skills to deepen understanding and aid retention.

Our in-house content management tool [Pagetree](https://github.com/ccnmtl/django-pagetree) provides the framework for our interactives. The JavaScript blocks hook into the content hierarchy using well-known patterns. The Pagetree infrastructure is a powerful and cost-effective approach when user data must be collected and analyzed. But, many of our interactives carry enough context to stand on their own statelessly. Our clients often want to make this class of content available in blogs, wikis and social media.

In summer of 2016, we, the developers at CTL, began exploring ways to make these interactives standalone and stateless. This portfolio is the result of our efforts.

The following [CompilED](https://compiled.ctl.columbia.edu) blog posts, detail the research and development behind these standalone interactives:

## The codes and this site

Interactives@CTL is built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) by [Zarina Mustapha](http://ctl.columbia.edu/about/team/mustapha/).

Our [software development team](https://compiled.ctl.columbia.edu/authors/), as well as most of our projects are accessible, responsive and open. You can follow our reflections on the technical aspects of the our work here in [CompilED](..) and on [Github](http://github.com/ccnmtl).
