The patient arrived early and you have completed your exam, prophy and flouride treatment. You look at the clock and realize you have a little time until your next patient and decide to spend some additional time discussing one or more of the options in the interactive.

Each activity is estimated to take a certain amount of time, but just like in real practice, things don't always go as planned. Select how you would use your remaining time.
