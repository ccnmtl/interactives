Int this simulation, two of classmates, Sally and Sam, are looking for some assistance with their career and practice management decisions as they prepare to move to North Oralington. North Oralington is a fictitious state created by data from actual counties and locations throughout the U.S. In the following activity students will learn more about Sally and Sam, and North Oralington, and help these classmates make an informed career decision.

At the end of the activity, students will have the opportunity to apply the same kind of data analysis and critical thinking to their own future practice aspirations.

This is a three-part activity:

1. [Advise Sam](/lib/careerplan/index.html?actorIdx=0&quiet=1) 
2. [Advise Sally](/lib/careerplan/index.html?actorIdx=1&quiet=1)
3. [Your career](/lib/careerplan/index.html?actorIdx=2&quiet=1)
