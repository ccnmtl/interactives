In this activity, the student plays a role of Springdale County Chair to the North Oralington State Dental Association (NOSDA). NOSDA was awarded a grant to help establish an oral health program that targets poor and low income rural adults. The student will review NOSDA proposals, select the strategy that will be most successful for improving oral health and access to dental care for poor/low-income rural adults, and finally defend the selected proposal before NOSDA leadership.
