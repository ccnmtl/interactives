Speech-language pathologists assess and treat individuals throughout their lifespan with speech disorders, language disorders, cognitive-communication disorders, and swallowing disorders. Pediatric dentists understand how collaboration with a speech-language pathologist can benefit the health and development of their patients. This infographic is a part of the Speech Pathology module in MATCH summarizing the age-specific behaviors warranting a speech-language pathology referral.
