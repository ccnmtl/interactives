Anticipatory guidance is a proactive developmentally based counseling technique that focuses on the needs of a child at each stage of life. By providing practical and contemporary health information to parents before significant physical, emotional and psychological milestones, parents will anticipate impending changes, maximize their child's developmental potential and identify their child's special needs. As primary care takers of children, PNPs and pediatric dentists can mutually reinforce this guidance.

This interactive is a JavaScript infographic designed to explain anticipatory guidance by age or developmental stage, using information adapted from _[Bright Futures: Guidelines for Health Supervision of Infants, Children, and Adolescents-Third Edition; AAP, 2008](https://brightfutures.aap.org/materials-and-tools/guidelines-and-pocket-guide/Pages/default.aspx)_
