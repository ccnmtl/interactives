This activity is designed to simulate of the process of choosing a site location for a dental program and advising on its overall operation and design.

The student plays the role of a licensed dentist working in a private suburban practice who is approached by the Adolescent Health Center (AHC) for consultation. The AHC needs assistance in expanding its health services to include an oral health program to serve the underserved poor/low income adolescents in the local neighborhood.

As a consultant, the student will be interviewing a number of community stakeholders who may provide some insights on how to design the dental program. Next, the student will need to present the recommendations and answer any questions regarding the program design.

As in real life, the simulation offers a limit to the time and effort that can be devoted to this project so that the student can be strategic and thoughtful regarding which stakeholders to choose what questions ask.
