Here you will learn about the low functioning older adult population and adults who need home care. You will also learn about home care services for homebound adults and oral health services provided by each.

Older adults are at high risk for developing chronic illnesses and related disabilities. Treating the older adult requires special approaches and an understanding of the physiologic, functional, psychosocial and environmental determinants of aging. Take a look at an aging couple's kitchen to identify a few areas of concern on nutrition and oral health.
