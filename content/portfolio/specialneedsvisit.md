Over the course of one's career as an oral health care provider the opportunity to meet individuals from all stages and stations in life will be great. Included among these individuals exists a category of persons whose health care needs are often neglected—persons with disabilities or special health care needs. While this occurs for varying reasons it is clear that even the process of identifying this group can be daunting. Persons with special needs encompass such a wide range of unique characteristics that the term “disability” does not have a single definition. While there is little doubt that this population has a significant economic impact on health care estimating its depth and breadth is often dependent on the definition used to classify the disability.

This interactive is part of an exercise demonstrating a scenario where a dental care provider is challenged with access and treatment options of the special needs population.
